## Terms of Service

_Last Updated: October 15, 2025_

By inviting or using the Clip Notifier Bot ("ClipLink") in your Discord server, you are agreeing to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). You also agree to abide by the Terms of Service and Privacy Policies of Discord and Twitch. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using the Bot.

### 1. Description of Service

The Bot is designed to monitor specified Twitch channels for new clips. When a new clip is created within a specific timeframe, the Bot will post a notification in a designated Discord channel. This notification includes details about the clip such as the title, creator, game, and links to view the clip and the original VOD on Twitch.

### 2. Acceptable Use

You agree to use the Bot only for its intended purposes and in a manner that does not violate any applicable laws or regulations.

- **Permissions:** To use the Bot's administrative commands (`/addstreamer`, `/removestreamer`), you must have the "Manage Channels" permission in your Discord server. You are responsible for ensuring the Bot has the necessary permissions (`View Channel`, `Send Messages`, `Embed Links`) in the designated notification channel.
- **API Usage:** The Bot interacts with the Twitch API, which is subject to rate limits. You agree not to abuse the Bot's commands in any way that could be construed as an attempt to spam or disrupt the Twitch API. The Bot has built-in limitations, such as a maximum of five monitored streamers per server, to prevent excessive API requests.
- **Prohibited Actions:** You may not use the Bot to engage in any activity that is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, or otherwise objectionable.

### 3. Service Availability

The Bot is provided "as is" and "as available." We do not guarantee that the service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free. The Bot's functionality depends on the availability and proper functioning of third-party services, including Discord and Twitch. Any issues or downtime with these services may impact the Bot's performance.

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the service at any time without prior notice.

### 4. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the developers of the Bot shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including but not to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses resulting from the use or the inability to use the service.

### 5. Termination

You may terminate your agreement to these Terms at any time by removing the Bot from your Discord server.

We reserve the right to terminate your access to the Bot without prior notice for any violation of these Terms or for any other reason at our sole discretion.

### 6. Changes to the Terms

We may revise these Terms of Service at any time. By continuing to use the Bot after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
