**Example:**
`/addstreamer twitch_user:shroud channel:#clips`

### `/liststreamers`
Lists all the streamers currently being monitored on the server.

**Example:**
`/liststreamers`

### `/removestreamer`
Removes a streamer from the monitoring list.

-   **`streamer`**: The ID of the streamer to remove. This field supports autocomplete to help you find the right one.
